## ðŸ”’ URL Safety with Google Safe Browsing

To protect users and prevent abuse, BitSnip integrates with the [Google Safe Browsing API](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing).  
Before shortening any URL, the app checks it against Googleâ€™s threat database for:

- Malware  
- Phishing (Social Engineering)  
- Unwanted Software  
- Potentially Harmful Applications  

If a URL is flagged, users will see an error, and the short link will **not be created**.

âœ… This feature is active in both development and production.
